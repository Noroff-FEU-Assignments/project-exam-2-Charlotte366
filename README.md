In this assignment we were to create a website for a fictional company called "Holidaze"
Holidaze is a local tourism agency that knows how to find the best booking opportunities in Bergen and the surrounding area

## Description

The website has a customer part and a admin part were the people who working for Holidaze can manage
bookings, editing and receive messages sent by customers.

The customer section consists of pages such as:
- Homepage
- A hotel list page where the customer can list out all the hotels
- The hotel specific page which displays all details about the hotel
- An enquiry page where the user can add a booking request for a specific hotel
- A contact page that the customers can use for general questions.
There should also be a search bar that would make it easy for the customer to search by name of the hotels.
Unfortunately, I did not manage to finish this by the submission date.

The admin section consists of pages such as:
- An admin login page where the user can log in. When logging in, a jwt token is stored 
  in the local storage and can be used as a validator for later requests.
- Page with 3 cards, were you can choose to go to 3 different pages such as
     - Administrate and see hotels
     - Handle booking enqueries
     - Handle contact requests
 - List of enquiries and new enquiries appear when user submits the form on the enquiry page
- List of messages from contact form
- The admin can create a new establishment
